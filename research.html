            <h2>Current Work - GeneSys</h2>
            <p>
                GeneSys is a full-stack system for accelerating deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers-based language models.
                It comprises a parameterizable NPU generator, which has been both taped out and prototyped on AWS F1 FPGAs, a full-stack multi-target compilation stack, and an RTL verification framework with a regression suite that includes synthetic and state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks like ResNet50, BERT, and GPT2.
                Additionally, GeneSys includes OpenCL-based Linux drivers, hardware synthesis scripts, a software simulator for profiling, and user-friendly Python APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary contribution to GeneSys has been the continued development of the system's compiler, which was originally written by Sean Kinzer.
