I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University in 2018.
While I was a student, I had the opportunity to work with the [Purdue SoCet](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoC-Team) team and take ECE 43700 "Computer Design and Prototyping" with Professor [T. N. Vijaykumar](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~vijay/), both of which inspired me to pursue a doctoral degree.
I also completed two summer internships at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/) working on pre-silicon verification and an internship at [NSWC Crane](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/Warfare-Centers/NSWC-Crane/) working on digital design; all three were virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
