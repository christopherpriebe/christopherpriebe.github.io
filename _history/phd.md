I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California San Diego where I am advised by Professor [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/). 
I work on compilers for cross-domain applications, multi-target compilers, and machine-learning-based compiler optimizations.
