        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I am advised by Hadi Esmaeilzadeh. My research is focussed on compilers. I also hold an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University.

            Please bear with me while I build this website as I am actively learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will be adding more content soon!
