Hi, I'm Chris!
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), where I am advised by [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/).
I also hold an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University.

My research is an interplay of compilers, machine learning, and systems.
More specifically, I am interested in compilers and systems for cross-domain applications (e.g., autonomous driving pipelines that could require signal processing, machine learning, and control theory), multi-target compilers (i.e., compilers that can target CPUs, GPUs, and domain-specific accelerators efficiently), and machine-learning-based compiler optimizations to enable the aforementioned techniques.

When I'm not in the office, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and weight training.
